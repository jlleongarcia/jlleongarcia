### Mermaid Live

I discovered mermaidJS diagrams thanks to [HUGO SSG](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/create-your-website/)

Thanks to mermaidJs, we can make cool **diagrams as a code**

And you can use it for free at: <mermaid.live>

## PPTs as Code

[Presentations as a Code](https://fossengineer.com/create-ppt-with-code/)

### SliDev

[Setup a SliDev Project](https://fossengineer.com/how-to-use-slidev/#the-slidev-project), like any other SSG:

1. Get Node and NPM
2. Initialize the SliDev project

```sh
npm init slidev #yarn create slidev
#npm run dev #if you want to restart where you left it
```

```sh
npm install -g @slidev/cli #npm install --save-dev @slidev/cli
npm i -D playwright-chromium
```

3. Modify the `slides.md` - Make changes to your ppt via markdown  

> It can create a [PPT assistant](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#slides-creation-agent) as seen on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-presentations-with-ai/)

### MARP and RemarkJS

[Two other options](https://fossengineer.com/create-ppt-with-code/#marp) to create PPTs as a Code.

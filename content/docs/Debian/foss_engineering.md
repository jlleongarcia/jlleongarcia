A list of F/OSS Apps that we can use with Debian to create Awsome Projects.

## OpenFOAM

[OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) is an **[open-source](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-11) computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** software, offering flexibility and customization but requiring advanced technical expertise for effective use.

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openfoam8

#source /opt/openfoam8/etc/bashrc
#foamInstallationTest
```

**ANSYS**, which you might know, on the other hand, is a commercial CFD software known for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive support, but it comes with licensing costs.

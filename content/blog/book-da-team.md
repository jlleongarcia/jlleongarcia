<!-- # Managing a Team -->

* Managing a team in data analytics involves coordinating a group of data professionals to extract meaningful insights from data to drive strategic decisions. 
    * It requires a strong understanding of data analysis methods, software tools, and the ability to translate complex findings into actionable strategies.

* To become a successful manager, you must foster a collaborative environment that encourages innovation, critical thinking, and continuous learning. 
    * Clearly communicate project goals, delegate tasks based on individual strengths, and guide their team in using various data analysis techniques.

Dont forget to ensure data integrity and quality control, handle resource allocation, and oversee project timelines, while regularly providing constructive feedback and encouraging professional development. Equally important is their role in bridging the gap between technical data findings and non-technical stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making across the organization.


## Know Yourself First

Having self-awareness is key before trying to manage others. **Before you attemp to manage others, learn to manage yourself**.

This topic alone, can cover tons of books, [but there are some basic concepts that will help you with self-awareness](https://fossengineer.com/Psychology-skills-data-analytics/). These are skills that enable people to manage their thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. As a result, **there is an increase of productivity**, improve job performance, and attain professional goals more effectively.

* Make sure that you can **focus** and work one task at the time:
    * Time is the most valuable resource - use it effectively and prevent irrelevant issues to interfere with your workflow
    * Learn how to use a [Kanban Board](https://fossengineer.com/focalboard-docker/) and its benefits to your workflow.
    * [Prioritizes tasks](https://fossengineer.com/business-skills-data-analytics/#priority-settings), Identifies more critical and less critical, adjusts priorities.
    * Estimate your tasks with reasonable precision and [meet schedules](https://fossengineer.com/business-skills-data-analytics/#estimations) for most of them, proactively identify if you can't meet the ETA and manage stakeholders expectations
* Be the best learner in the team:
    * Think and analyze how can your approach to work can be better
    * Share what you learn with the rest of the team

* Focus on the result:
    * Keep in mind the desired outcome when planning tasks, [organizing meetings](https://fossengineer.com/effective-meetings-data-analytics/) or coordinating activities.

* Review your knowledge about [time management techniques](https://fossengineer.com/time-management-data-analytics):
    * Pomodoro:
        * [The-Wise-Pomodoro](https://the-wise-pomodoro.firebaseapp.com/)
        * [Focus Tide](https://focustide.app/)
        * Focus-To-Do, ToDoIst
    * Others: ABC Analysis, [Pareto (80/20)](https://fossengineer.com/pareto-principle-for-data-analytics/), Eisenhower Matrix *(Do, Decide, Delegate, Delete)*
    * [~~Multi-Tasking~~](https://fossengineer.com/time-management-data-analytics/#avoid-multi-tasking)
* Be adaptable

## Motivating the Team

**Progress have been found as the best form of human motivation**. It creates momentum and affirm our faith of future success.

Seek to understand the **M**inimal **V**iable **P**rogress that a new team member can deliver.

### Mentoring

Mentoring is the assistance provided by one person to another in achieving substantial changes in knowledge, work, and thinking. The goal of mentoring is to help and encourage individuals to optimize their own learning so that they may reach their full potential, develop their abilities, enhance their performance, and become the person they want to be.

It is typically a long-term process, often without a predefined time limit, focused on fostering growth, confidence, and self-awareness in broader life and career contexts. A mentor usually provides advice, shares experiences, and offers wisdom to help their mentee navigate challenges and seize opportunities.


* Experience in mentoring, for example with newcomers, is invaluable. Having mentored before, these individuals understand the journey and challenges that a beginner might face. They have a rich repository of experiences and lessons learned, which can be instrumental in guiding their mentees. Experience also imparts a level of empathy and patience, critical attributes for mentoring relationships that help mentors understand the perspectives and difficulties of those new to a field, fostering an environment of trust and open communication.

* Knowledge transfer is another crucial aspect of mentoring. This involves more than just sharing information; it's about teaching concepts, methods, and practices in a manner that the mentee can understand and apply in their work. Mentors need to break down complex topics, connect theoretical knowledge with practical applications, and explain ideas in a clear, engaging way.

* As a mentor should be able to provide necessary knowledge support. This might involve conducting specialized lectures, creating and providing resource materials, or assisting with work activities. This support isn't just about aiding in skill development, it's about empowering the mentee to perform their duties confidently, independently, and effectively.

* Constructive feedback helps mentees understand their strengths and areas of improvement. A good mentor is candid yet tactful, delivering feedback that motivates, encourages self-reflection, and drives improvement. Additionally, it's important that mentors communicate the mentee's progress and areas of concern to relevant stakeholders. This collaborative feedback process ensures that everyone involved in the mentee's development is aligned and can contribute positively to their growth.

### Coaching 

Coaching, often a more task-oriented and performance-focused approach, involves instructing, training, and guiding a team or individual to improve specific skills or achieve particular goals. **It is generally time-bound and tied to specific tasks** at hand, with the coach possessing expertise in the area they're providing guidance. 

### Developing Others

When it comes to developing others, the capability to share both positive and negative feedback in a timely fashion plays a key role. This process entails a mutual understanding and agreement on how the individual can improve based on this feedback.

The aim is to engage in a constructive dialogue, arriving at mutual agreements on how to enhance performance based on this feedback.

Ensuring that channels of communication and feedback remain open and continuous is essential. This ongoing dialogue fosters a supportive environment where growth and development are constantly encouraged.

Moreover, offering coaching and support can greatly enhance both team and individual outcomes. This not only helps in addressing performance issues but also motivates individuals to continually strive for excellence.

Finally, it's important to plan for the future by preparing a dedicated group of successors. This proactive approach ensures that the team continues to thrive, maintaining its performance and productivity even during times of transition.

#### Addressing performance problems

Addressing performance problems as a data manager involves a nuanced and multi-step approach:

* Firstly, the manager must identify the problem through performance metrics, regular reviews, or team feedback. Once the issue is pinpointed, they should have a private, one-on-one conversation with the individual concerned, ensuring to approach the conversation with empathy and respect.

* As a manager, provide clear, specific examples of performance issues and their impact on the team or project, offering an opportunity for the individual to share their perspective.

* Work together with the individual to develop a performance improvement plan, which outlines clear, measurable objectives, and the support and resources they will provide to help achieve these goals.

* Regular check-ins should be scheduled to track progress and make adjustments as necessary. The manager should also consider broader actions, such as offering additional training or coaching to the individual or the entire team if similar problems are prevalent. 

Remember, maintaining open communication, showing patience, and expressing a commitment to the individual's growth can help foster a positive environment for improvement.

#### Creating PDPs

* Creating a Personal Development Plan (PDP) for a team member in a data manager role involves some specific considerations.
    * **Role Evaluation**: Understand the responsibilities and demands of the data manager role. Identify the critical skills required for this role, including technical skills (such as SQL, Python, or data visualization), project management skills, and interpersonal skills.
    * **Self-Assessment**: Have the team member assess their current skills, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis). This will help in understanding their performance and where there are areas for improvement.
    * **Goal Setting**: Help the team member set short-term and long-term goals. These goals should align with both their personal career aspirations and the organization's objectives. They should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
    * **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identify the skills and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to achieve these goals. This could involve advanced technical skills, leadership abilities, or communication skills, among others.
    * **Action Plan**: Develop a plan for how they will acquire the necessary skills or knowledge. This could involve attending training sessions, pursuing certifications, gaining practical experience, or seeking mentorship.
    * **Time Frame**: Set a timeline for when each goal should be achieved. Having deadlines helps maintain focus and urgency.
    * **Resources**: Determine what resources are needed, such as access to specific training programs, conferences, or mentors.
    * **Tracking Progress**: Decide on a method to track progress towards the goals. This could involve regular performance reviews, project outcomes, or feedback from team members.
    * **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review the PDP and adjust as necessary. This includes accommodating changes in the organization's direction, market trends in data management, or the team member's career aspirations.

Remember, creating a PDP is a collaborative effort. Encourage the team member to take ownership of their plan, while you provide support, guidance, and resources. This will ensure that they remain motivated and engaged in their development.

## Teamwork and Collaboration

Teamwork and collaboration revolve around a collection of skills that equip an employee to work diligently alongside others towards shared team objectives. These skills foster a spirit of cooperation, enabling team members to assign responsibilities and reach consensus on work tasks collectively.

Moreover, successful teamwork involves open and proactive sharing of information and ideas, which helps drive collective efforts towards common goals. This approach not only boosts team productivity but also strengthens interpersonal relationships within the team.

Beyond merely working together, effective team members actively seek opportunities to nurture positive, productive relationships with their colleagues. By taking the initiative to build these connections, they contribute to a cohesive, high-performing team that thrives on collaboration.

##  Improving Team's Performance

Improving team performance is not always about making huge changes or drastic improvements. Rather, it can be achieved through small, consistent, and incremental improvements that compound over time. Each small step may not seem significant in isolation, but when combined and sustained over a period, these small changes can lead to substantial improvements in overall team performance.

**Remember about the compound effect** - As each team member enhances their skills and capabilities, they contribute more effectively to the team's goals, thereby improving the team's collective performance. Over time, this continuous improvement can lead to a high-performing team that exceeds its objectives.

### Kaizen & Pareto

It's all about the mindset - Small improvements in things that we do often.

But remember, most things that need fixing will lead to marginal improvements [Diminishing Returns, anyone?](https://fossengineer.com/pareto-principle-for-data-analytics/#pareto--diminishing-returns).

Focus on the thing (*the most important do that you do frequently*) that when fixed, will improved all the others like a waterfall.

### Enabling Others

Open questions can stimulate discussion, creativity, and collaboration, enabling team members to learn from each other, build stronger relationships, and work together more effectively.

Moreover, open questions signal to others that their opinions are valued and their experiences matter, which can enhance their confidence, motivation, and engagement.

* Some good examples?:
    * What obstacles / bottleknecks are you finding?
    * How could I help you overcome them?
    * What led you to this particular conclusion?
    * If you could start this project again, what would you do differently?
    * Knowing what you know now, how would you handle a similar situation in the future?
    * What steps will you take to achieve these goals?
    * Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?

### Meeting Facilitation

* Cultivate the ability to initiate discussions effectively, establishing the purpose and significance of a meeting with either an internal team or client's team clearly and succinctly.
* Prioritize the creation and maintenance of a [well-defined meeting agenda](https://fossengineer.com/effective-meetings-data-analytics/#as-a-meeting-owner), ensuring it is adhered to within the specified timeframe. **Build agreements on specific outcomes and actions**.
* Actively seek out clarifications, provide insights, and consistently summarize key points throughout the discussion to keep the conversation focused and productive.
* Maintain a keen attentiveness to others' inputs, accurately interpreting their messages and responding appropriately to maintain effective communication.
* Be prepared to create [simple](https://fossengineer.com/business-analytics-skills/#diagrams) yet structured and [visually engaging materials](https://fossengineer.com/business-intelligence-data-analytics/) that aid in conveying your points clearly and effectively.
* Develop proficiency in at least one [data visualization tool](https://fossengineer.com/better-visualizations-data-analytics/) to illustrate your data-driven insights effectively during discussions.
* Master the art of summarizing meeting outcomes concisely, and commit to a structured follow-up to ensure continuity and progress after the meeting.

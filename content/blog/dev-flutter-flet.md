To write **Flutter from Python**, you can use the Flet framework. Flet is a Python library that allows you to build Flutter apps without having to write any Dart code.

To use Flet, you first need to install it using pip:

```sh
pip install flet #https://pypi.org/project/flet/
```

```py
app = flet.App()
```

Once you have created the flet.App object, you can start adding widgets to it. To do this, you use the flet.App.add() method. For example, to add a button to your app, you would use the following code:


Yes, Flet can generate static pages. In fact, this is one of its main strengths. Flet uses a technology called Pyodide to compile your Python code into WebAssembly (WASM), which is a binary format that can be executed in any web browser. This means that you can deploy your Flet app to any static web hosting service, such as GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages.

To generate a static page from your Flet app, simply run the following command:

```sh
flet publish
```

This will create a directory called build that contains all of the static files for your app. You can then deploy these files to any static web hosting service.

Here are some of the benefits of generating static pages with Flet:

* Performance: Static pages are much faster than dynamic pages because they do not need to be rendered on the server. This makes Flet apps a good choice for websites that need to be able to handle a lot of traffic.
* Security: Static pages are also more secure than dynamic pages because they are not vulnerable to server-side attacks.
* Portability: Static pages can be deployed to any web server, including cheap and shared hosting plans. This makes Flet apps a good choice for websites that need to be able to scale to handle a lot of traffic.


Overall, Flet is a great choice for developers who are looking for a fast, efficient, and secure way to generate static pages.

    * Under the hood, NiceGUI uses JustPy, which in turn is built on top of Starlette (an asynchronous ASGI framework) and other web technologies.
    *  library to write simple graphical user interfaces in Python we discovered JustPy. Although we liked the approach, it is too "low-level HTML" for our daily usage. But it inspired us to use **Vue and Quasar** for the frontend.

    * **Allows WebSockets**


    REST API (HTTP):
        RESTful APIs are widely used for communication between clients and servers over HTTP.
        They are well-suited for request-response interactions and are easy to understand and implement.
        However, they may not be the best choice for real-time communication as they are based on the request-response model, which can introduce latency and overhead for real-time updates.
        REST APIs are suitable for scenarios where real-time updates are not critical or where the frequency of updates is low.

    WebSockets:
        WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
        They offer low-latency, high-performance communication and are well-suited for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, and multiplayer games.
        WebSockets can be more complex to implement compared to REST APIs, but they offer significant benefits for real-time applications.

    MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):
        MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.
        It provides a flexible and efficient mechanism for asynchronous, real-time communication between clients and servers.
        MQTT is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications, telemetry systems, and messaging applications where real-time data streams need to be transmitted reliably and efficiently.
        While MQTT can be used for real-time communication in various scenarios, it may not be as widely supported or as easy to integrate as REST APIs or WebSockets in certain contexts.    

We have built on top of FastAPI, which itself is based on the ASGI framework Starlette and the ASGI webserver Uvicorn because of their great performance and ease of use.
* JustPY
    * JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming. JustPy can also be used to create graphic user interfaces for Python programs.

#### Python for Web Assembly

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It's designed as a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and now, even Python, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. In simpler terms, 

> WebAssembly allows you to run code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web at near-native speed.

#### What it is Pyodide?
Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly.

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten.

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with micropip. Any pure Python package with a wheel available on PyPI is supported. Many packages with C extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide.

## Proposing Solutions: From Concept to Value Realization

This guide focuses on the business analysis activities involved in evaluating solutions, identifying limitations, and recommending actions to maximize value. It covers the process from initial prototypes to fully operational releases.

### Solution Evaluation: Unlocking Value Creation

Solution evaluation is the ongoing process of assessing a solution's performance and the value it delivers.  Business analysts play a key role in identifying and addressing any obstacles that hinder value realization.  This evaluation can be applied to:

* **Prototypes/Proofs of Concept (PoCs):** Limited but functional versions demonstrating value.
* **Pilot/Beta Releases:** Limited implementations used to identify issues and assess value before full release.
* **Operational Releases:** Full versions used to achieve business objectives.

### Key Solution Evaluation Tasks

1. **Measure Solution Performance:** Define and implement appropriate methods to assess solution performance, aligning with enterprise goals and objectives.

2. **Analyze Performance Measures:** Examine performance data to understand the value delivered and determine if the solution meets current business needs.

3. **Assess Solution Limitations:** Investigate issues within the solution's scope that may prevent it from meeting business needs.

4. **Assess Enterprise Limitations:** Identify issues *outside* the solution's scope that may be hindering value realization.

5. **Recommend Actions to Increase Solution Value:** Define actions to bridge the gap between potential and actual value.

### Recommendation Samples: From "Do Nothing" to Solution Retirement

Recommendations can range from maintaining the status quo to retiring a solution:

* **Do Nothing:** Recommended when the value of change is low, risks are high, or resources are unavailable.

* **Organizational Change:**  Managing the people side of change. This might involve:
    * Automating/Simplifying Work: Identifying tasks suitable for automation or re-engineering.
    * Improving Information Access:  Enhancing information availability and quality.
    * Reducing Interface Complexity: Streamlining interactions between systems or people.
    * Eliminating Redundancy: Consolidating solutions to address common needs.
    * Avoiding Waste: Removing non-value-adding activities.

* **Identify Additional Capabilities:**  Recognizing and leveraging potential future value beyond initial requirements.

* **Retire the Solution:**  Planning for the replacement or retirement of a solution due to obsolescence, changing needs, or failure to meet objectives.  Consider:
    * Ongoing cost vs. initial investment
    * Opportunity cost of alternative solutions
    * Necessity (e.g., obsolescence)
    * Sunk cost (avoid letting past investment cloud future decisions – focus on future costs and benefits).

### Key Considerations for Recommendations

* **Value Realization:** The primary goal is to maximize the value delivered by the solution.
* **Feasibility:** Recommendations must be realistic and achievable.
* **Stakeholder Buy-in:**  Involve stakeholders in the evaluation and recommendation process.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Solution evaluation is an ongoing process to drive continuous improvement.

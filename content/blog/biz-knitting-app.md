### GaugesWatch

You need to create a test of the pattern:

![KeyStatic CMS with LandingPad Theme](/blog_img/apps/knitting/gaugeswatch.jpeg)

With that, you will know: the **weight ~12g**

* Before blocking:
    * Area = 12.5x13.5cm

* After blocking:
    * Area = 12.5x15.0cm

> The material will let you know its *density*, like **100m / 50g**.

## The Math

We just need to sum areas...of the designed completed.

Why i needed that?

I got the ig profile shared via email, and they are...making you go back to the app, with a QR code.
